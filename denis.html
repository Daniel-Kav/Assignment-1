    <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>

    <h2>1. Prepare the Batter:</h2>
    <p>
      Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Grease and flour a 9-inch round cake pan.
      Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Set aside. Cream butter
      and sugar until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well
      after each addition. Stir in vanilla. Gradually add flour mixture and
      milk, alternating between the two, starting and ending with the flour.
      Fold in sprinkles.

    <h2>2. Bake Cake:</h2>
    <p>
      Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick
      inserted into the center comes out clean. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes,
      then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
    </p>
    <h2>3. Frost and Decorate:</h2>
    <p>
      Frost cake with your favorite frosting and decorate with additional
      sprinkles. Slice and serve!
